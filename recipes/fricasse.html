        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p> This is a chicken variant of the dish as i am lazy to redo this page over again after realizing there are various ways that a fricassee can be made</p>
        <ol>

          <li>
            Take the skin off the shredded chicken and put the chicken in the fridge for a little while. Put the chicken skin in a pot along with the 1/2 onion, paprika, thyme, rosemary, and water. Boil for 10 minutes then grind it up with a stick blender or food processor. Continue to cook it until it's reduced down to one cup.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Chop up the carrots, celery and onion then set aside. In a frying pan melt the butter and add the onions and garlic. When the onions become translucent add the flour to the mix.
          </li>

          <li>
            When you have added the flour to the onions and given it a bit of a stir around it is time to add the carrots and celery. Give it another stir then add the milk, cover with a lid and let it cook for 10 minutes.
          </li>

          <li>
            After 10 minutes of cooking it is time to use the stock that we made earlier. Just pour it into the frying pan and put the lid on again. Leave it for another 10 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once the veggies are cooked it's time to add the last ingredients, frozen peas, chicken and parsley, plus salt and pepper to taste. Give it a good stir and make sure it's hot and then you're ready to serve.
          </li>

          <li>
            Optional - This chicken fricassee is delicious on its own, or, you could have some mashed potato with it like we did. Also rice would go nicely with this dish.
